If it says wine is not installed, type "lscpu" to confirm if the system is 32 or 64 bit. Then, type "sudo apt install wine32/wine64". To confirm the installation, type "wine --version" to visualise the version and then type "wine eHelp.exe". Donot touch any other files your the patient's safety concerns.
