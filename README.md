Below Mentioned are the Steps to Start with the Quest :

Step 0 : Download the [Game Setup](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Er2kK_8jUZvTQ5pBYF8uF1weva04v02J/view?usp=sharing).

a) For Windows Users, Uncompress the file exec.zip, and run the eHelp.exe. Donot touch any other files for your the patient's safety concerns. Navigate through the environment, meanwhile we explain how to play around in it.

b) For Linux Users, Uncompress the file exec.zip, Go to the Folder where the file is, open a terminal in that path, type "wine application.exe". If it says wine is not installed, type "lscpu" to confirm if the system is 32 or 64 bit. Then, type "sudo apt install wine32/wine64". To confirm the installation, type "wine --version" to visualise the version and then type "wine eHelp.exe". Donot touch any other files for your the patient's safety concerns. Navigate through the environment, meanwhile we explain how to play around in it.

c) For Mac Users, Open a Windows Virtual Machine (VMWare/Parallels Desktop), and follow the same as the Windows Users.

Step 1 : Open the [Google Colab Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HhLDuqT4r4NMGte0pcpi3G_tjP6Rk7Fx?usp=sharing). Don't worry at all if you have never used it. You are the perfect candidate for our quest then. If you have worked with Colab before, you know what to do.
